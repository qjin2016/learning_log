### Socket in Python (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzrGwor2veQ&index=55&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDe8XSftW-RAxdo6OmaeL85M)

- computer network programming (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network_programming):
  - connection-oriented communication, e.g. TCP, Transmission Control Protocol
  - connection-less communication, e.g. UCP, User Datagram Protocol
  
### Thread vs Process (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/200469/what-is-the-difference-between-a-process-and-a-thread)

- both threads and processes are independent sequences of execution
- threads run in a shared memory space
- processes run in seperated memory space
- some useful references: https://pymotw.com/2/threading/
- examples: https://github.com/qjin2016/learning_log/blob/master/assets/notebooks/threading.ipynb
