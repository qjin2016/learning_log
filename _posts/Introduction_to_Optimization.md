## C2, Vector Spaces and Matrices

- linearly independent

- span

- basis of a subspace

- dimension of a subspace, dim V

- natural basis

- rank of a matrix, rank A, the maximal number of linearly independent columns of A

- determinant of matrix A, |A|

- a non-singular (invertible) matrix is a square matrix whose determinant is nonzero

- non-singular: AB = BA = I

- symmetric: A = A^T
